International periodically updated COVID-19 pandemic models:

DELP: DELPHI. Differential Equations Lead to Predictions of Hospitalizations and Infections. COVID-19 pandemic model named DELPHI developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge. https://covidanalytics.io/projections

IHME: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. COVID-19 pandemic model by developed Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Seattle. https://covid19.healthdata.org/global?view=cumulative-deaths&tab=trend

IMPE: Imperial. COVID-19 pandemic model developed by Imperial College, London. https://mrc-ide.github.io/global-lmic-reports/

**Predicative performance error measures for COVID-19 daily deaths in international periodically updated epidemic models 2020-2022 by country** 

Two color schemes for error measures are used for each model: (a) deciles of the individual epidemic model, and (b) deciles of mean of all epidemic models. The first map differentiates countries in each individual model and the second map facilitates comparison across all models.
